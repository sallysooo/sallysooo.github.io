      Hi! I'm Jisoo Kim, also known as sallysooo. With a strong interest in anomaly detection and AI-based intrusion detection systems (IDS), I’m actively exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, while also delving into various deep learning topics such as LLMs and time series analysis. 
I enjoy combining hands-on projects with academic research—whether it’s reproducing Security/AI papers, designing CTF challenges, or experimenting with cutting-edge deep learning techniques across diverse domains.
I’m eager to grow as a researcher and engineer who contributes to building secure, intelligent, and impactful AI systems.
