With a strong interest in `anomaly detection` and `AI-based intrusion detection systems (IDS)`, I’m actively exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, while also delving into various deep learning topics such as LLMs and time series analysis. 

I enjoy combining hands-on projects with academic research — whether it’s reproducing Security/AI papers, designing CTF challenges, or experimenting with cutting-edge deep learning techniques across diverse domains.

I’m eager to grow as a researcher and engineer who contributes to building secure, intelligent, and impactful AI systems.
