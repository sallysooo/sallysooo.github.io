Hi, I’m Jisoo Kim — a Data Science & Big Data Engineering junior at `Sookmyung Women’s University` and an undergraduate research intern at `SNSec Lab` (SMWU). Previously, I’ve been active in `SISS (Sookmyung Information Security Study)` as a member for 3 years and also served as a Web Hacking Academic Director.

I’m especially interested in `anomaly detection`, `AI-driven security`, and `intrusion detection systems (IDS)`. I work on real-time anomaly detection for automotive Ethernet traffic using unsupervised deep learning, with a focus on building practical, security-relevant detection pipelines. I also enjoy connecting academic ideas to hands-on work: reproducing Security/AI papers, designing web hacking CTF challenges, and leading various ML/DL projects.

My goal is to grow into a researcher and engineer who helps build secure, trustworthy, and impactful AI systems. If you’d like to collaborate on security research, anomaly detection, or applied ML/DL projects, feel free to reach out!
